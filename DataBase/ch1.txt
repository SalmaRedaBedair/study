===introduction===
-database:collection of related data
-database properties:
       -represent some aspect of real world ,it called mini world 
           any change in miniworld is reflected in database
       -logically coherent
       -built for specific purpose 
-database system: refers to data and DBMS 
                     Examples of database systems: oracle my sql server ,my sql
-database can be any size and complexity 
-data base may be generated and maintained manually or computerized
  library card catalog =>manually
  computrized=>by group of application programs writtten for that task 
             or by data base mangement system 
===Database management system(DBMS) ===
collction of programs enable users to create and maintain data base
-DBMS facilitates: defining, constructing, manipulating, sharing,protecting.
-defining: specifing data types 
-meta-data: database definition or descriptive
-constructing: sorting data base in some storage meduim
-manipulating: update database to reflect changes in miniworld
-sharing: database alow multible useres to access database simultaneously.
-protection: againest hardware and software malfunction
-app program: access data by sending query to DBMS
              querey: cause some data to be retraived
              transaction: casue some data to be read or written
-it is not necessary to use genral purpos DBMS to implement computrized DB,
 we can make our own program
 in either case we usually have to deploy a considerable amount of complex software
 DBMS is a complex software systems
-DB & DBMS are called database system
-records in verios files of database may be related 
-quiries and updates must be specified in langouage of DBMS before processing

=====design new app for existing database====
-design new app for existing database need requirements specification and analysis
   requirements=>conceptual design=>logical design=>physical design
-conceptual design:can be represented and manipulated using some computerized
tools
-logical design: can be expressed in data model implemented in commerical DBMS
-physical design: provided for sorting and accessing data 

=====file processing & data base=====
-file processing: each user define files need specific software as part of programming the app
 each file maintained seperatly
 this redundancy result in wastage storage 
-database: single reposity maintain data
 define once access by many user 
 each app free to name data independantly => any update update all data but in file i need to update each indepentantlly

======characteristics of database systems===
1-Self-Describing Nature of a Database System: database systems contain not only data but also charachteristic of these data
2-Insulation between Programs and Data,and Data Abstraction :
  The structure of data files is stored in the DBMS catalog separately
  from the access programs
3-support multible of views: every user use database for diffrent purpose
4-Sharing of Data and Multiuser Transaction Processing:
  DBMS must include concurrency
  control software to ensure that several users trying to update the same data do 
  so in a controlled manner so that the result of the updates is correct.
-transaction: is an excuting or process include one or more database access
-DBMS must enforce several transiction properities :
 1-isolation: each transiction appears to perform in isolation form
 2-automicity: ensure that either or database operations in transiction are excuted or none
====Actors on scence===
1-database administrator(DBA): resposible for 
  -access database
  -coordinate and monitoring its use
  -acuring software and hardware as needed
  -security branches and poor system response
2-database designer: responsible for
  -identifing data to be able to store 
  -choose appropriate structure to store and represent data
  -interact with all useres to develop view of database that meet their requirements
3-end users
  i-casual end useres: need diffrent information each time
  ii-naive or parametric end users: constatly querying and update database 
  iii-Sophisticated end users: include engineers, scientists, business analysts, and
      others who thoroughly familiarize themselves with the facilities of the
      DBMS in order to implement their own applications to meet their complex
      requirements.
  iv-standalone user: maintain personal database by using ready-made program package  
4-software engineer: should be familiar with the full range of capabilities provided 
  by the DBMS to accomplish their tasks
  determine requrements for end user
  develope specification for standard canned transactions

====workers behind scence====
work with DBNS
1-database managment design and implemnter: design DBMS
2-tool developer: design and implemnt tool(software package)
3-Operators and maintenance personnel: mantainance hardware and software for DBMS

==========Advantages of Using the DBMS Approach=========
A-redundancy in sorting same data multiple times lead to several problems:
 1-update will be done multible times 
 2-storage space is wasted
 3-data inconsistent
-we should have database design that store the same logical data item in only one place in database
-denormalization: store related data in one place so i will not search multiple times
B-Restricting Unauthorized Access:
  1-most users will not have access to see all data in database
  2-some users will be primited to retraive data
  3-DBMS must have security and authorization subsystem which DBA use to create accounts and
    add restrictions 
c-Providing Storage Structures and Search Techniques for Efficient Query Processing
 1-DBMS need specialized data structure and search techniques to speed up disk search
 2-auxiliary files called indexes  usd for that purpose
 3-in order to make paricular query, records must be copied from disk to main memory
 4-DBMS hryas buffering or caching module maintain parts of database in main memory
 5-The query processing and optimization module of the DBMS is responsible for
  choosing an efficient query execution plan for each query based on the existing storage
  structures. The choice of which indexes to create and maintain is part of physical
  database design and tuning, which is one of the responsibilities of the DBA staff
==Providing Multiple User Interfaces: 
 -query language => casual usere
 -programing language interface => application programmers
 -forms and commands codes => parametric users
 -menu-driven and natural language interfaces=> standalone users
