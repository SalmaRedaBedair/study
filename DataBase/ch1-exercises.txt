1.1)data: some ammount of information which we need to record and store, i will need to use 
          it later
    database: collection of related data
    DBMS: collection of programs allow users to maintain databases
    database system: refers to data and DBMS 
                     Examples of database systems: oracle my sql server ,my sql
    database catalog: descripe data
    program-data independence: any update in high level schema will not affect low evel
                               levels are: 1-external level
                                           2-concpetual level(logical level)
                                           3-pghysical level
    user view: many users use databse for diffrent purposes 
    DBA: who is managing DBMS,he have all facilties,he is resposible for security,
         hardware and software for DB, he make account and choose specifications for each user
    end user: require access for querying,updating and generating reports
    canned transiction: standard types of quering and updating to constantly quering and updating database
    deductive database systems: provide capabilities for definig deduction rules for 
                                inferecying new information from database facts
   metadata: description for data
 1.3)database any changes will change all program 
     file processing change in one file need change in the others
==Self-Describing Nature of a Database System
traditional file description is part of program 
     these programs are used for specifc purpopose whosse structure is declares in the application program
DBMS description in catalog any programs that use the same DBNS should work equally
==Insulation between Programs and Data,and Data Abstraction
traditional any change in one file need change all programs that access this file
DBMS use abstraction so any data that is used many times write once 
==multiple of views 
DBMS every user can access only data he want its useful in big data
traditional file he will access all data 
share data 
DBMS have concurrency contol so any update in data affect all files 
traditionl files are not
1.4)DBA i have talked above
Design: design how data will look like and how to store and he talk with all users to make it support difrent point of views
