-you should faguire out some potential problems and solving them before release your app into real world
-Analysis helps you ensure your system works in a real-world context.
-use case must be precise and tell what will be donr in our system i detail
 it can be not in the same form of book 
 it should make sence for me and i can explain it to my co-worker or customer
-system may be contain multiple use cases if there is steps seperate from the others
-Each use case should detail one particular user goal
-calss uml not contain constructors and steps that you will do to do function
-delegation helps our applications stay loosely coupled. That means that your objects are independent of each other; in other words, changes to one object don’t require you to make a bunch of changes to other objects
-by delagation we abstruct the details about what makes two barks the same away from BarkRecognizer class.
-after delegation any updates in my code will not require update alot of things ,i will update only one class
-Your objects are shielded from implementation changes in other objects.
-i should circle nouns in my use case to make sure i don't forget to make any class or function ,some of this nouns maybe not used do i should have sence and understand my program
-nouns of usecase represent textual analysis
-A good use case clearly and accurately explains what a system does, in language that’s easily understood.
-With a good use case complete, textual analysis is a quick and easy way to figure out the classes in your system.
-textual analysis tell us to focus on some classes not the ionly classes we will need
-verbs in use case are method for its nouns
-page 184 very important
-in uml: what is written in the arow is an attribute of the class before with the type of the class after
