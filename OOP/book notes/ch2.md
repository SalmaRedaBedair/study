# CH2 
- A use case is a technique for capturing the
- potential requirements of a new system or software change.
- Each use case provides one or more scenarios that convey how
- the system should interact with the end user or another
- system to achieve a specific goal.
## every use case has 3 parts
 # 1- Clear Value
   - Every use case must have a clear
    - value to the system. If the use case
   - doesn’t help the customer achieve their
   - goal, then the use case isn’t of much use.
 # 2-Start and Stop
   - Every use case must have a definite
    - starting and stopping point. Something
   - must begin the process, and then there must be a
   - condition that indicates that the process is complete.
 # 3-External Initiator
   - Every use case is started off by an external
   - initiator, outside of the system. Sometimes
   - that initiator is a person, but it could be
   - anything outside of the system.
