## architecture
- architecture: your design structure, highlights most important parts of your app, and relationships between those parts
- when you work in the same system with many people all of them should understand architecture
## functionality
- i should start focusing on functionlaity and must focus on the most important things first
## raletionships between diffrent parts
- you should first focus on diffrent functionalities of your app individually and then start doing relations  between them
## three QS of architecture
- ### is it part of the essence of the system ?
  - can you imagine system without that feature
  - if not then found a feature which is essence of system
- ### what the .... does it mean ?
  - spend more time understand the feature very good so you do not waste time solving problem you don't undertand well
  - spend time with those features early, rather than late
- ### how the heck do i do it ?
  - if that problem is new for you spend more time to think of it very good 
  - do not create many problems down the road
## to know what is the part to start with next 
- you should start with the part that more related with the previous and you can know that with the help architecture
