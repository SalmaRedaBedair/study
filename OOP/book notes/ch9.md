## feature driven developement
- it focus on only one feature and bulid it and then go to another one and work 
- it is more detailed than use case
- it focus on only one scenario but usecase has diffrent scenarios
## when to use feature driven development
- if your customer is impatient and want to see actual output, and start with feature you have already worked on
## test code
- you should make test scenario to test your code working as your customer want it to do
- you should think of test before writing code
- ### when test you should test
  - the code work as you want
  - when changing any thing it change right
  - when you try to access property that have actual value you should return that it has no value (test for incorrect usage of your system)
